Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children 
in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the only president born outside the contiguous 
48 states. He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. 
His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), 
was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,with some German, 
Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.
In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended 
from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia 
during the seventeenth century. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),
was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.
Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at 
Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.
The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, 
six months before Obama was born
